# Webmastor

Hiya! I'm kiako, your friendly Webmastor. Generally, I'm responsible for:

- Keeping the [website](<https://agoranomic.org/>) up-to-date,
- Checking in on officer pages (such as this one),
- Managing the [AgoraNomic GitHub Organization](<https://github.com/AgoraNomic>), and
- Finding and recording off-site resources made by players.

If you're ever in need of assistance with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, or scripting, feel free to reach out to me!

- [Workflows](/Webmastor/workflows.html) contains all my scripts/workflows for Webmastor duties.

## The Index

I'm currently configuring a workflow to allow this page to display my monthly report. For now, you can view the raw data here:

- [Directory](<https://github.com/AgoraNomic/Webmastor/blob/main/Directory.yaml>)
- [Changelog](<https://github.com/AgoraNomic/Webmastor/blob/main/Changelog.yaml>)
- [Warnings](<https://github.com/AgoraNomic/Webmastor/blob/main/Warnings.yaml>)
- [Errors](<https://github.com/AgoraNomic/Webmastor/blob/main/Errors.yaml>)
